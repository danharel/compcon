Hello.

First, thank you. Second, I'm sorry.

COMP/CON is a new project, built (initially) as a small thing meant only for my friends (and no one but me would ever have to look inside), then it exploded in scope. A lot of the code in here, as of this writing, is first-blush implementation. If you see something that's nonsensical or dumb it's more than likely because it is - don't hesitate to submit a PR.

A fully-fleshed-out contributor's guide is pending. In the meantime, take a look at the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/jarena3/compcon/projects) and get in touch on the Discord
