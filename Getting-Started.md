Hello.

First, thank you. Second, I'm sorry.

COMP/CON is a new project, built (initially) as a small thing meant only for my friends (and no one but me would ever have to look inside), then it exploded in scope. A lot of the code in here, as of this writing, is first-blush implementation. If you see something that's nonsensical or dumb it's more than likely because it is - don't hesitate to submit a PR.

It's (March '19) awaiting a first clean-up/refactoring effort, just a heads up.

In the near term, here's the stuff that needs doing:
- Test Coverage *(reggaeton triple airhorn blast)*
- Project restructuring, probably into a 'Features' tree, as lots of bigger Vue/Vuex projects are wont to do
- Docs
- Vue-related performance improvements (lazy loading, moving things out of `computed`, etc)

Outside of that, check out the Issues tab for Bugs/Feature Requests
