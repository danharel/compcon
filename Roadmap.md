## v1.4
### ~Cloud Saves~ ✅

### ~Cloud-hosted Pilot and Mech art~ ✅

### ~Per-Item Notes~ ✅

### ~Better Stat Contribution Visibility~ ✅

### More LANCER Glyphs
More custom LANCER Glyphs

## v1.5
### Active Mode
COMP/CON needs to be able to run games of LANCER, both on the GM side and the player side. Active Mode should present an easy way for players to track mech stats, equipment state and usage, and turn progress.

### Tutorial Mode
COMP/CON should be a smoother, easier character creator than the core pdf at a minimum, but it should be easy for first-time users in the general sense. Many Vue tutorial-builder modules exist, and COMP/CON should use one to help guide new players through the pilot and config editors. At a minimum, we should have tutorials for New Pilot, Level Pilot, and New Config (and probably also loadouts and retrofitting)

### Charts
We have damage and range data, so we should be able to provide users with things like nice, reactive damage-at-range (and other!) charts for their mech loadouts

## v1.6

### Gear Catalogue Comparison View
Users should be able to use the Catalogue to compare stats between two or more items. Ideally this should be an openable window for reference when building loadouts.

### More Print Options
Users should have the ability to select from a few print templates (portrait, landscape, embellished, etc) as well as printing a set of D&D-esque "Power Cards", filled in with relevant stat bonuses and system abilities.

### Exotic and Custom Items
Users should be able to add Pilot and Mech gear not present in the rulebook. Saving, storing, and importing/exporting these items will be a good starting point to building out the mod manager framework.

### Item Actions
Mech systems (and some weapons) add or enhance combat abilities. These should be moved into a more explicit data structure so we can reason about them in the future -- and do things like offer a DnD4e-style "Action Card" print format

## v2+

### Mobile Versions
COMP/CON should offer an Android/iOS tablet version with the same features as the desktop app. It should also have a phone app for the same OSes, although some features might be restricted due to reduced screen sizes.

### Modding Tools
COMP/CON should include a full-featured license editor, so users could add homebrew frames and items. It should also be easy to group these licenses into packages, import/export these packages, and enable or disable their use when creating pilots and configurations

### GM Tools
Building enemy combatants/NPCs is nearly as involved as building pilots. Likewise, COMP/CON should have generators and editors for enemy and NPC creation, and allow users to make, save, edit, group, and print sheets for use in gameplay.

Additionally, there are plenty of generators in the rulebook that could be trivially ported to COMP/CON (eg: planet generator, resource tables, mission profiles

Far-future GM tools could include things like initiative trackers, campaign logs/wikis, and faction trackers.
